AdiBags is a World of Warcraft addon that displays the contents of your bags in single view, distributed into several sections using smart filters. It is heavily inspired by Nargiddley's Baggins.

Configuration is available through Blizzard addon panel, the `/adibags` chat command, and by configuring "right-click to open options" and right clicking on any blank space in the bag window.

For more information, please refer to the offical AdiBags addon: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/adibags

## Redux - "Recent Items" begone!

This is a janky hacked up version of AdiBags that removes the "Recent Items" category.  New items can still be configured to highlight/glow, but they will be auto-sorted into the appropriate item category.

As a bonus, the bag window width is fixed to the configured width, instead of being dynamic.
